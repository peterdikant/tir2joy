<h1>TrackIR 2 Joystick Converter</h1>

<p><b>(c) 2003 by Peter Dikant (<a href="mailto:peter@dikant.de">peter@dikant.de</a>)</b></p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>TrackIR can only work with games that either support the TrackIR device directly or support
mouselook. Unfortunatly some 
games use joystick axes to control the view. The <em>tir2joy</em>
utility will convert mouse movements to movements of a virtual joystick device. It will enable
the use of TrackIR in games with joystick look support (like Nascar Racing 2003 and F1 Challenge).</p>

<p>If the TrackIR software has the enhanced mode activated, this mode will be used instead of the default
mouse movement. This is the prefered operation mode for the converter.</p>

<p><b>This software uses Deon van der Westhuysen's excellent virtual Joystick driver 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/deonvdw/PPJoy.htm">PPJoy</a>.</b></p>
